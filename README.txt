- For leap and server there is an executable, the vive has to be started from the Unity editor.
- If the boxes are stack on each other, interaction is not guaranteed, because the Leap scripts for changing
color and pinch detection do not work properly, and there seems to be problems with the collider (does not trigger correctily).
